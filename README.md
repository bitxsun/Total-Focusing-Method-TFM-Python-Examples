## File Descriptions
1. The 'scode-script-tfm-interp.py' is the python script example for TFM algorithm by using interpulation approach.
2. The 'scode-script-tfm-enarest.py' is the python script example for TFM algorithm by using nearesr point search approach.
3. The 'sdata-5mhz-els18-steel5850.amt' is the example data which is a full matrix capture (FMC) dataset acquired from a 5mhz, 18-element linear ultrasonic array sticker on a 50mm thickness mild steel sample. The ultrasonic longitudinal velocity is 5850 m/s. A side-drilled hole (SDH) defect is designed in that sample, which is located at 25mm in depth.
